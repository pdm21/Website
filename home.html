                I am student-athlete at <a href="https://www.hamilton.edu/">Hamilton College</a>, where I am a junior studying computer science and mathematics. I have extensive experience in a wide array of programming languages including Python, Java and C++, as well as a solid understanding of Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Algorithms, and Assembly Language. Further, I have taken a variety of math courses that supplement my computer science education.
                <br> 
                <br>
                I have also been the <a href="https://athletics.hamilton.edu/sports/mens-soccer/roster/pandelis-margaronis/6922">captain</a> of the varsity men's soccer team since the start of my sophomore year.
                <br>
                <br>
                When I am not writing code, I am playing sports, or being involved on campus in some way. I am a member of the AppDev Team at Hamilton, as well as a student assistant in the Fitness and Recreation Centers. Further, I am an RA, and the Founder of Hamilton Sports Give Back, an organization I am working on that will facilitate the donation of sports gear and equipment by Hamilton student-athletes to the youth in the local community.
